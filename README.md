#DOCUMENTATION

I set up a responsive mobile friendly HTML5 website for a running club. The club members can find useful information about the upcoming events the club will be involved. This club is promoting a healthy lifestyle and can be very popular for people of all ages. 


##Color choice

I used a mix of orange / grey theme for the website . It is very easy to be read, even by colorblind people. It is creating a very good contrast and the information can be read clearly.


##Privacy policy

I generated the General Data Protection Regulation law articles that apply for my website. We are collecting email addresses from the members because we are sending regular newsletters. Regarding the distance selling, there is not the case here, because the website is only informing the members about the club / events etc.
