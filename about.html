Our home is The Pavilion Sports and Leisure Club in Eltham where we meet up every Wednesday and Friday evening for a prompt 7pm start.  Every session has a variety of distances/paces on offer (including walking) and we like to mix our running schedules with regular fitness evenings from our qualified coach. On top of this, if you like to take in the Kent country side, then why not join us for a nice social Sunday morning run!  In addition to our running, we have a comprehensive programme of social activities throughout the year. Please feel free to come and join us for a run, we will ensure you are looked after no matter what your ability level !</p>
